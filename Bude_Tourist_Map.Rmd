Figure 1 shows the roadmap and watercolor map of Bude, UK. 

**Bude** is a small seaside resort town in north Cornwall, England, UK, in the civil parish of Bude-Stratton and at the mouth of the River Neet (also known locally as the River Strat). It is sometimes formerly known as Bude Haven. Its earlier importance was as a harbour, and then a source of sea sand useful for improving the moorland soil. The Victorians favoured it as a watering place, and it was a popular seaside destination in the 20th century.

For the convinence of plotting tourist sites, a separate set of roadmap and watercolor map of Bude is reproduced in Figure 3 and Figure 4. The town is famous for its surfing beaches and cricket grounds and some recommended tourist attractions are marked out in these two maps. Blue dots represent two surfing beaches: **Summerleaze Beach** and **Crooklets Beach**. The green dot indicates the location of the famous **Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club**. Besides, we want to find a pub near the cricket ground, and **Bar 35** is marked by the red dot on both maps. The yellow path shown in both road map and watercolor map is the route from Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club to Bar 35.

# Summerleaze Beach

Summerleaze Beach is Bude’s central hub of sand, surf and sun, and it’s the first port of call for many visitors.

Clean, safe and easy on the eye, Summerleaze Beach is a big hit with surfers, beach bums and families. However, it is the sheer variety of activities that mark Summerleaze as arguably the best beach in Cornwall for outdoor pursuits and water sports.

There are superb local surf schools, for example, but you could also try kayaking, sea fishing or sample the thrills of climbing or coasteering with friendly professionals.

Summerleaze Beach also has features that show why Bude is popular for family friendly and disability friendly holidays.  Summerleaze offers level access and a flat viewing area, for example, while a cute, sheltered sea pool is ideal for young ones to have a salt water dip. For a serious spot of loafing, there are also cute beach huts to hire.

# Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club

Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club is situated on the clifftops overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, and is quite simply one of the most stunning locations you could ever wish to visit, let alone play cricket at! 

Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club was founded in 1870. Over the years it has played host to Hockey matches, Tennis, Cricket and even used for Mortar practice in WW2!

Bude played only friendly matches until the late 1970's, entertaining local and touring sides throughout the summer months. Since joining the Cornwall Cricket League the club has held various league honours and still continues to host touring teams from around the world. 

Currently the club has three senior sides. The 1st XI play in Cornwall Division 3 and the 2nd XI in Division 5. In addition we have a Sunday league side in the North Devon League Division 2. Bude North Cornwall Cricket Club also has a thriving junior section. 

In 2013 our ageing pavilion (around 100 years old) was demolished and replaced with a fantastic new clubhouse, the ground is now a stunning place to watch cricket as well as play it!
